# SparkleBase Daemon

**Sparkle** is the data collection daemon for [sparklebase.com](https://sparklebase.com).

It will collect the following data points:
* Architecture and OS version (if available)
* Memory information such as total installed memory, memory in use, swap, etcâ€¦
* Uptime information

*Besides mentioned metrics no personal data will be collected!* 

## Installation

### Daemon installation
Requirements: `golang` distribution of your system vendor (Linux, MacOS, *BSD).

```
This will install the daemon in your `$GOPATH`. If you did not change the location it will install the daemon in `~/go/bin/sparkle`


### Receiving Metrics

Will transmit the data once and exit.

If you wish to send data on a regular basis you can make use of cronjobs:

```
$ crontab -e

*/15 * * * * /home/myself/go/bin/sparkle b7b8bc83-bedc-4e58-88d6-cf484a5d1798
